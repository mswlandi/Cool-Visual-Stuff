# Cool Visual Stuff
Collection of personal implementations of patterns, fractals and cool visual stuff using the javascript library [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

It's pretty cool and there's a [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org) (which I use) that makes it a lot easier.

The code for each sketch is in sketch.js, in it's respective folder. To just view the visual thingy, open index.html.

(in the future, I plan to make an "universal gif recorder" to use on p5js, and then upload the gifs in their respective descriptions here)

## Recursive Squares
A recursive implementation of the gif seen [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/design-processing-blackandwhite-6DxgByF70i5pe).
This was my first real try with the p5.js library. [web editor link](https://editor.p5js.org/MSWLandi/sketches/SJKfcL5aX)

## Recursive RGB Triangle
I wanted to make a profile picture for my github profile, and thought of doing one of those RGB triangles, but with a twist: it's recursively subdivided into mini-triangles, each with its own solid color. Here's the result.

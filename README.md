# Cool Visual Stuff
Collection of personal implementations of patterns, fractals and cool visual stuff using the javascript library [p5.js](https://p5js.org).

It's pretty cool and there's a [web editor](https://editor.p5js.org) (which I use) that makes it a lot easier.

The code for each sketch is in sketch.js. To just view the visual thingy, open index.html.

## Recursive Squares
A recursive implementation of the gif seen [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/design-processing-blackandwhite-6DxgByF70i5pe).
This was my first real try with the p5.js library. [web editor link](https://editor.p5js.org/MSWLandi/sketches/SJKfcL5aX)
